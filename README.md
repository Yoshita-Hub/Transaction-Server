Transaction server intends to  manage X number of data objects that can be thought of as banking accounts; each account is holding a certain amount of money. The number of accounts is configurable.
When we start transaction server, each account is initialized to some configurable amount.
Accounts can be "over-drafted", resulting in a negative balance. 
Account balances can be read and can be written.
